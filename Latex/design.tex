Computer Vision algorithms can only give as good result as the source videostream that it is 
being fed. After talking a bit to SINTEF, some test videos were provided by them. However, as seen in figure 
\vref{fig:sintef_not_1}, the quality leaves much to be desired. The video provided had a resolution 
of $854 \times 480$ pixels with big black box padding around it. This does not only make 
the video unsuitable for us in a computer vision algorithm, but it also means that the video 
probably is upscaled quite a bit.

Due to the poor nature of the quality of the video it was decided early on that 
a field test was needed, since we were going to use equivalent hardware as to what is available on the ROV.

\section{SINTEF DVL Test}
This lead to us helping SINTEF out with a doppler velocity log test using a rig for controlling 
the movement of the \todo{not som i garn?}. As a favour for us helping out, we 
got to lend the rig at a later time when our hardware were ready to do a field test. 

During this test, we learned enough ab the rig and operation of it that we should be able to operate 
it ourselves.

The rig was configured to mimic the approximate distance to the net 
in figure \vref{fig:sintef_not_1}. We were however not able to tilt the camera to 
an angle due to environmental constraint in a anchor chain situated below the camera.
We approximated the distance between the ROV and the net in figure \vref{fig:sintef_not_1} to be 
\SI{1.5}{\metre}. This lead to a the image in \vref{fig:test_hd_referanse}

\end{figure}

Comparing image \vref{fig:test_hd_referanse} and \vref{fig:sintef_not_1}, it seems that the 
top row of masks is approximately the same in both images. Due to the tilt of the 
camera in image \ref{fig:sintef_not_1} we get a prominent vanishing point in that image. There 
are also some growing on the net in \ref{fig:sintef_not_1}, which of obvious reasons does not appear 
in \ref{fig:test_hd_referanse}.
