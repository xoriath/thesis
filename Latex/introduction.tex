\chapter{Introduction}
During the last four decades, the demand for fish 
has been steadily increasing. The current level 
of demand supersedes the amount of fish that 
can be fished and keep the different stocks of 
fish at a sustainable level. This has lead to 
overfishing, eliminating for instance the 
fish population on the Grand Banks off the east 
coast of America. Many other fish 
populations are also either gone or in fast 
diminish. Some scientists are even predicting 
that with the current overfishing, the fish industry will 
see a global collapse during this century \citet{worm06}.
